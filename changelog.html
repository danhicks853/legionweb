                        <li><strong>Fixed:</strong> An issue where players could not teleport back to Wyrmrest after defeating Zon'ozz in Dragonsoul.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tuned:</strong> Player melee damage was too high in raids. Tuned down to be more in line with spell damage, which is in a good place.</li>
                        <li><strong>Removed:</strong> Time-Twisted Geists from End Time - Ruby Dragonshrine (H) cannot be killed when cannibalize is active and have been removed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Talking Fish from Temple of the Jade Serpent will no longer put you to sleep with its tales.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fixed:</strong> Sha of Doubt from Temple of the Jade Serpent can no longer hide behind his unopenable door.</li>
                        <li><strong>Closed:</strong> Bloodmaul Slag Mines has been closed for the time being to allow for time to address double spawns across the entire instance. Apparently, it's bring your twin ogre to work day.</li>
                        <li><strong>Closed:</strong> Auchindoon didn't get the memo and didn't bring anyone to work today. Closed due to being completely empty.</li>
                        <li><strong>Closed:</strong> Meanwhile, Irondocks brought the right amount of people to work, but they're all way too high level, so they've all been fired as well, and the dungeon has been closed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Notice:</strong> For mid 90's leveling, please choose specific dungeons for now.</li>
